thinkful_shop-list
==================
The Shopping List app uses the HTML5 LocalStorage API to preserve list items upon page refresh, and uses jQuery for UI manipulation and event listening.


Overview of Project:
In this lesson, you’ll design and code a project from scratch: a shopping list app. 

The basic requirements for this app are:
- Users should be able to enter items they need to purchase
- Users should be able to check and uncheck items on the list (you don’t necessarily need to use checkboxes for this, but there should be a way of visually distinguishing purchased and unpurchased items).
- Users should also be able to permanently remove items from the list.
- It will be up to you to come up with the look and feel of your app, and you’ll start off with that in the first assignment. You should first form a clear idea of what you want to build before you start building it. Next, build an initial version of your app that demonstrates the layout and style, but does not have the interactive elements. Finally, in the third part of this project, use jQuery and JavaScript to write the code that will make your app interactive.
- This project will be the most challenging yet because you’ll be almost entirely on your own, bringing together everything you’ve learned so far. You’ll get to practice designing and wireframing, HTML, styling with CSS, and using jQuery events to add interactive behaviors. To get a sense of what’s possible, have a look at what previous Thinkful students have built (and while you can look under the hood of these projects to see strategies others have used — this is a key programming skill! — please refrain from copy-pasting code from these projects as that won’t help you develop your own skills):

By completing this project, you’ll solidify the skills you’ve learned so far, giving you a solid foundation as we move on to programming fundamentals with JavaScript in Unit 3.
